TASK 3 - Secure Coding Review
Choose a programming language and application. Review the code for security vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for secure coding practices.
Use tools like static code analyzers or manual code review.

This is a Project I made as a part of Course Work
Performing a Secure code review on this application to find and fix its vulnerabilities.

Securing an application is as Important as Building the Application.

Let's Hear About Secure Coding from OWASP

Source code analysis tools, also known as Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Tools, can help analyze source code or compiled versions of code to help find security flaws. (WhiteBox Testing)

SAST tools can be added to your IDE. Such tools can help you detect issues during software development. SAST tool feedback can save time and effort, especially when compared to finding vulnerabilities later in the development cycle

SAST - Important Selection Criteria
Prerequisite: Support your programming language.
Ability to detect vulnerabilities, based on:
The OWASP Top Ten
Other criteria such as:
OSSTMM
CHECK
Accuracy:
False Positive/False Negative rates
OWASP Benchmark score
Ability to understand the libraries/frameworks you need
Requirement for buildable source code
Ability to run against binaries (instead of source)
Availability as a plugin into preferred developer IDEs
Ease of setup/use
Ability to include in Continuous Integration/Deployment tools
License cost (May vary by user, organization, app, or lines of code)
Interoperability of output:
See OASIS SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format)

These are some tools we can use to perform Secure Coding Analysis -
OWASP - Source Code Analysis Tools
NIST - Source Code Security Analyzers
Wikipedia - List of tools for static code analysis
OWASP Project Benchmarks - Link
According to My Project, I found these Tools useful and I am exploring them.

HCL AppScan - Open Source, Free - Link
Pyre - Open Source, Free - Link
Veracode - Open Source, Free - Link
Through the Manual Secure Coding Review of My Application I followed OWASP's Top Ten

Fixed the Broken Access Control - Using JWT Token
Fixed the Cryptographic Failures - By Applying Encryption to the Data in the DataBase
Working on other Vulnerabilities too.
As a part of this Internship Program I have worked on these as of now.
I will be continuing to work on these even after the Internship period (driven by passion)
Conclusion
This is a great experience to learn Secure Coding Review and to correct the mistakes I made as a developer before.
